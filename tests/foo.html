<p class="p1">We sat down with our friend Kyle Anthony Miller to get some insight on his journey as a designer and what inspires him.</p>
<p class="p1"><img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/1b570ce16c3922b3bb681463c87b3eac/tumblr_inline_n3tnmxainB1r2rl91.jpg"/></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Tell us a little about yourself (your background, when you started designing, the moment you decided to make design a career)</strong></p>
<p class="p1">I grew up in a small town in Central Pennsylvania with the itch to always get out. In spring of 2012, I fled for the beautiful hills of Los Angeles with one goal in mind: to find my best self. In this case, that meant I was going to do whatever it took to take my career to its full potential. </p>

<p class="p1"></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><!-- more --></strong></p>
<p class="p1">Inspired by modern architecture, I initially wanted to be come an architect, or maybe I just wanted to design anything with meaning. To create something that people would interact with everyday, whether they live in it or use it it to represent their company. In high school, I dabbled in some screen printing classes which led me to designing apparel.</p>
<p class="p1">Shortly after that I expanded to designing for major music labels&#8212;all by the age of 19.</p>
<p><strong>How have you gained experience in the design industry?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">I spend a lot of time designing. I’ve learned that you’re only going to get better by creating, and I don’t limit myself to only gaining experience by sitting in front of a computer screen. I love to explore and my mind is constantly running; taking in inspiration all around me.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What are your favorite pieces you’ve worked on thus far?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">I’d have to say the branding for Grouper Social Club, a tee shirt and henley line for Ebbets Field Flannels and a cover/spread for Orange Coast Magazine.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Wha</strong>t are some current projects you are working on?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Grouper is for sure a never ending project and I’m okay with that. I’ve been venturing out a lot in LA and have been inspired by numerals I’ve been finding on mid-century homes in the hills. Recently I created my first set of numerals that will be making its debut on celebrity photographer Don Flood’s new home in Santa Monica Canyon. Pretty excited that it’s found a good home.</p>

<p><strong>Who would you love to collaborate with one day?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Living in LA, I’ve separated myself from the scene a bit. The scene being the entrainment industry, however, I would love to work with an Art Director for a major motion picture.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>If you weren’t a designer, what do you think you would be doing?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Architect.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/37ab890ad363e1ab923d68c7f39f87f4/tumblr_inline_n3tovnSYRd1r2rl91.png"/>What’s your personal style like? What are some of your favorite clothing stores to shop at?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Classic and Iconic. Really been liking everything from Jack Spade, Rag and Bone, Wings and Horns and Nudie just to name a few.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What do you do in your free time when you are not eating, breathing and dreaming design?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">I really like to explore LA with my lovely girlfriend and my new pup. I’m still pretty new here, and this city is damn big. It’s beautiful where we live and it keeps my head clear to keep focusing on my goals.</p>
<p class="p1"><img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/b98e669a21e82dcf9d690c503e410a54/tumblr_inline_n3tr0roa0l1r2rl91.jpg"/></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What’s the biggest difference between when you started designing and now?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">When I first started out I didn’t know my place, and when it comes down to it, we’re all just searching for our place in this world. Now that I’ve found my niche and a style I’m comfortable with, I can focus on being a smarter, more business oriented designer.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Where do you find inspiration? Any inspirational quotes you live by?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Taking photos of everything. Seriously everything. Getting out of the house and making memories is what makes my life more meaningful.</p>
<p class="p1"><img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/1f4883f42bbcafe3acea17e6b65cc1e6/tumblr_inline_n3txvofJ4S1r2rl91.png"/></p>
<p>I saw a quote recently that said, “the only limit is the one you set for yourself.” I can live by that.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The big question: Do you believe artists wanting to create a name for themselves in the design industry need to go to school?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">No. I don’t think that school has anything to do with creating a name for yourself. Either you have the talent or you don’t.
<p class="p1">The biggest thing college did for me was just get me more interested in design. In short I’ve never had a client ask me where I’ve went to school, and in the end your work will speak for itself.</p>
